This is a minimal Angular client scaffold produced from the existing static frontend.

Quick start (after installing Node.js and npm):
1. cd client
2. npm install
3. npm run start

This app contains a simple `SchedulingService` that implements FCFS, SJF (non-preemptive), SRTF (preemptive), and Round Robin algorithms. UI components live under `src/app/components/`.

Notes:
- This is a front-end migration only; you will add backend code in a separate `backend/` folder as requested.
- The project expects the Angular CLI to be available via `npx` or installed globally to run the scripts.
